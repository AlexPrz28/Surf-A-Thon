# Surf-A-Thon
program that prints the 3 places of a contest from .txt file

If you want to read your own .txt file you have to make a file with the name and position, you must put it in this way: "Ronald 45". the program will separate the number and the score with the space between them.

The .txt file can be anywhere but you must have the correct file path to run the project.
